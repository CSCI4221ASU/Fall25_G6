         Role:

            The role I'm responsible for in this project is the documentation. It's my job to facilitate the collaboration between my team members. It's also important for me to maintain, debug, and update the software in order to reduce the time spent on understanding the code. I also have to enhance the user experience by adding user manuals, guides, and more in order to reduce the need for direct support. Most importantly, I support the software development lifecycle by providing records of requirements, design decisions, and processes from the initial concept to the deployment.
